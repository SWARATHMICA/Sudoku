Sudoku Solver
Project Overview
The Sudoku Solver is a Python-based application that solves Sudoku puzzles using a backtracking algorithm. Sudoku is a popular number puzzle game that challenges players to fill a 9x9 grid with digits from 1 to 9, ensuring that each row, column, and 3x3 subgrid contains all digits without repetition. This  project provides a tool to automatically solve Sudoku puzzles of varying complexities.

Key Features
Sudoku Solving: The solver employs a backtracking algorithm to find the solution to Sudoku puzzles.
Random Puzzle Generation: Generates random Sudoku puzzles for solving.
User-Friendly Interface: Provides clear and easy-to-read puzzle displays.
Educational: Offers insights into how backtracking algorithms work for Sudoku solving.

Getting Started
Clone the project repository to your local machine.
Run the Python script to generate a random Sudoku puzzle.
The solver will calculate and display both the initial puzzle and the solved solution.
Usage
The Sudoku Solver simplifies Sudoku puzzle solving. It generates random puzzles for you to solve, providing a hands-on experience in understanding how backtracking algorithms can solve complex puzzles efficiently.
